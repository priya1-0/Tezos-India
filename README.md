TezAsia Hackathon 3.0 - Project Submission 
This application is similar to a student portal. The student chooses their preferred subjects at the time of account creation and will keep received subject materials based on the choosen preferences. Similar to this the teacher also chooses their preferences. Once Teacher posts material based on the preference selected by the teacher and student the content is shared. For example, If a teacher whose preference is Science shares some material, then all students who have chosen science as their preference will receive this material on their feed. The feed automatically refresh after certain time. The students can raise questions on the post, the teacher will receive a private message from students and can privately reply back.
